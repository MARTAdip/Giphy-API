# Giphy-API

The project consists in a single page-app, that call the Giphy API, with Search and Trending endpoints. When a user lands on the page, he/she will see the trending Gif images from Giphy, and a search input is included at the top, where the user can search for Gifs of his/her choice. 

To run this locally please use the live-server on the command line from inside the folder.
